class Vacuum_Environment:
    """
    A class representing one clean room and one dirty room for a vacuum agent.

    ...

    Attributes
    ----------
    world : list
        an integer list representing the two rooms and the agent: A agent is represented with a 1 and the empty room
        with a 0.
    dirty_room : list
        an integer list representing the two rooms: a clean room is represented with a 0 and a dirty room is represented
        with a 1.
    agent_action : str
        the action the agent will do in the environment.
    environment_won : bool
        Keeps track of whether the environment it is currently in is already won.
    score : int
        Keeps track of the number of times the agent has completed the environments' tasks.

    Methods
    -------
    create_world()
        Sets the 'world' class variable representing the rooms of the environment and agent inside of it.

    create_dirt()
        Sets the 'dirty_room' class variable representing the clean and dirty room inside of it.

    agent_program(agent)
        Makes the object agent's percepts and sets that inside of the agent. Then, it calls agent.rules() to get the
        agent's action and sets that equal to the 'agent_action' class variable.

    change_environment()
        Changes the state of the environment based on the agent_action class variable.

    get_dirt_status()
        Getter for the status of the dirty room in the environment.

    __repr__()
        Represents the class when printed as a formatted string of the 'world' class variable and 'dirty_room' class
        variable.
